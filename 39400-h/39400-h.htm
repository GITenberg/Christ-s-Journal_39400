<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Christ’s Journal</i>, the author takes a daring step
in this unique novel and places the reader for the first time in the shoes of
The Fisherman. In this finely crafted and historically realistic portrait of
the ancient Biblical world, Bartlett recreates the moving story of the last
months of Christ’s life as Jesus Himself may have experienced them when He
brought to mankind a message of love and enduring hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><i>hrist’s Journal </i>is one of
five independent works of fiction which together make up <i>Voices from the
Past</i>, a quintet of novels that de­scribe the inner lives of five extraordinary
people. Progressing through time from the most distant to the most recent they
are: Sappho of Lesbos, the famous Greek poet; Jesus; Leonardo da Vinci; Shakes­peare;
and Abraham Lincoln. For the most part, little is known about the inward realities
of these people, about their personal thoughts, reflections, and the qual­ity
and nature of their feelings. For this reason they have become no more than
voices from the past: The contributions they have left us remain, but little re­mains
of each person, of his or her personality, of the loves, fears, pleasures,
hatreds, beliefs, and thoughts each had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Voices from the Past</i> was written by Paul Alexander
Bartlett over a period of several decades. After his death in an automobile
accident in 1990, the manu­scripts of the five novels were discovered among his
as yet unpublished papers. He had been at work adding the finishing touches to
the manuscripts. Now, more than a decade and a half after his death, the
publication of <i>Voices from the Past</i> is overdue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bartlett is known for his fiction, including <i>When the Owl
Cries</i> and <i>Adiós Mi México</i>, historical novels set during the Mexican
Revolution of 1910 and descrip­tive of hacienda life, <i>Forward, Children!</i>,
a powerful antiwar novel, and numerous short stories. He was also the author of
books of poetry, including <i>Spokes for Memory</i> and <i>Wherehill</i>, the
nonfiction work, <i>The Haciendas of Mexico: An Artist’s Record</i>,<i> </i>the
first extensive artistic and photographic study of haciendas through­out
Mexico, and numerous articles about the Mexican haciendas. Bartlett was also an
artist whose paintings, illustrations, and drawings have been exhibited in more
than 40 one-man shows in leading museums in the U.S. and Mexico. Archives of
his work and literary correspondence have now been established at the American
Heritage Center of the University of Wyoming, the Nettie Lee Benson Latin
American Collection of the University of Texas, and the Rare Books Collection
of the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul Alexander Bartlett’s life was lived with a single value
always central: a sustained dedication to beauty, which he believed was the
most vital value of living and his reason for his life as a writer and an
artist. <i>Voices from the Past</i> re­flects this commitment, for he believed that
these five voices, in their different ways, express a passion for life, for the
creative spirit, and ultimately for beauty in a variety of its forms—poetic and
natural (Sappho), spiritual (Jesus), scientific and artistic (da Vinci),
literary (Shakespeare), and humanitarian (Lincoln). In this work, he has
sought, as faithfully as possible, to relay across time a renewed lyri­cal
meaning of these remarkable individuals, lending them his own voice, with a
mood, simplicity, depth of feeling, and love of beauty that were his, and, he
be­lieved, also theirs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The journal form has been used only rarely in works of
fiction. Bartlett be­lieved that as a form of literature the journal offers the
most effective way to bring back to life the life-worlds of significant,
unique, highly individual, and important creators. In each of the novels that
make up <i>Voices from the Past,</i> his interest is to portray the inner
experience of exceptional and special people, about whom there is scant
knowledge on this level. During the many years of research he devoted to a
study of the lives and thoughts of Sappho, Jesus, Leo­nardo, Shakespeare, and
Lincoln, he sought to base the journals on what is known and what can be
surmised about the person behind each voice, and he wove into each journal
passages from their writings and the substance of the testimony of others. Yet
the five novels are fiction: They re-express in an author’s creation lives now
buried by the passage of centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:0in'>he sun is setting. The evening is
very warm. Across the fields I hear children’s voices as they play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This evening I have been reading the <i>Psalms</i> and their
beauty fills my mind. I have decided to write my thoughts, not because I am a
psalmist, but because I hope to get closer to the meaning of life. Of course I
should have started writing long ago. When I was in the wilderness I had an
opportunity. Now, it is hard for me to find the time, and writing is not a
habit of mine and does not come easily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, like a shepherd, I shall gather together my
thoughts, watching for strays. In spite of vigilance my thoughts may wander.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is pleasant sitting here at this table, the night air
blowing in; a star is caught in a tree. Peter is talking to a friend; Peter’s
voice has always pleased me, so deep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, when I was in Naim, someone pointed out a sick
man huddled in rags at a street corner. It was one of those windy days and dust
spun around us. The man reached up his arms and mumbled; I remembered seeing
him before and maybe he remembered me. I felt his hope; I felt I could help,
and I said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Pick up your mat, get up...walk... God will help you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fellow trembled. He seemed to shrink inside himself as
if afraid of me. He closed his eyes and doubled his hands. I waited and then
repeated my com­mand slowly. Like someone in a dream he untangled his rags and
knelt. As he rolled his mat I encouraged him. Glancing about furtively, he
stood, tottered. I thought he would fall but he kept his eyes on mine and I
urged him to walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Master...master,” he muttered, staring about uncertainly.
“Master...where... how can I?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Limping, carrying his mat under one arm, he headed for the
synagogue and as I watched he began to walk easily. He threw down his mat and
began to run. Dust swirled around us and he disappeared from sight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>Later, someone told me he
had been bedridden, crippled for almost forty years. Forty years—he had been
crippled longer than I had lived! Now he was walking...running... I felt such
joy, such joy, all day. I couldn’t eat when I sat at the table at Peter’s; his
mother scolded me. To please her I nibbled a little fruit. I couldn’t find
anyone who could share my joy so I walked alone, roamed the countryside. As I
walked I could see his tortured face, dirty beard, beggar’s clothes. Forty
years...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His name is Simeon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably I will see Simeon soon. And what shall I say when
he thanks me? What can he say? I will see a changed man and that will be
enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>t seems only yesterday I was in
Nazareth yet that yesterday was years ago. Regardless of the passage of time I
feel the summer heat and hear flies buzzing. Father is at work in his shop.
Whitey comes to me and meows; she’s scared of the thunder rumbling in the dis­tance;
she’s hungry too. Mama is cooking and the smell of beef is everywhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father begins to saw and sawdust spills over his feet. I
lean against a wall and sunshine spreads and I feel everything impregnate me,
the stucco, earth floor, the bench, the broken handle of the saw, Father
batting flies that try to settle on his beard. This will last forever. Caught
in the web of time we will eat supper together, before lamp lighting, and
Whitey will sit on my lap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recall another afternoon years ago—the same place. But
Father is upset, talking volubly, denouncing Herod and his tyranny, an old, old
story for all of us. I have tried to deny the truth of that story but there it
is, Herod’s soldiers slaughtering innocent children, hoping to kill me. Surely
I hate the man and yet I have learned to pity his blundering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a boy I wandered, praying, asking understanding. The dry
hills were un­communicative. If it is impossible to forgive it is possible to
look ahead. I felt too that my guilt might become a disease. I saw that the
past can have too pow­erful an influence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tomorrow I am to preach on a hill... Peter says the weather
will be fine. I hope so, after windy days. For weeks we have had wind and cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, in my room at Peter’s, I am discontented. The windows
try to send me outdoors. They face cornfields and the corn is waist high, brown
and roughly swaying. I wish I could stretch out in the middle of a field, lie
there and watch the clouds and listen to the wind. I am happiest when outdoors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun is down but I won’t light my candle; instead, I’ll
watch the coming night and perhaps I can summon thoughts for tomorrow; perhaps
something will talk to me in the cornfields, something I can impart. Friends
and strangers will arrive tomorrow...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Darkness has taken over and I can barely see to write...a
cricket speaks...may profound thoughts come.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I spoke to them on a little hill, a rocky place. It wasn’t
windy or hot and we were not troubled by flies and as I stood before them,
fishermen, villagers, friends and strangers, sitting on rocks and on the
ground, on shawls and blan­kets, I was deeply moved. I was specially moved by
an old woman near me who never took her eyes off me. Dressed in blue, her
clothes in tatters, her face gleamed. Wrinkled cheeks were kind. There was
kindness in her folded hands, but, most of all, it was the compassion in her
eyes, soft, tearful, blue eyes, that had searched for so long and hoped for so
long. Hers was the patience of the poor. Her spirit became my spirit as I
talked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blessed are the poor...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
You are the salt of the earth—you are the light of the world. Let your light so
shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in
heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blessed are the meek,” I said, “for they shall inherit the
earth. Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted...blessed are
those who hunger after justice...blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain
mercy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The old woman had buried her face in her hands: she was my
mother and every mother, sincerity and love, the symbol of integrity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A breeze came and white clouds piled along the horizon. The
crowd in­creased and the hill was covered with people. Shepherds approached and
held their flocks in check, listening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“...Rejoice and be exceedingly glad,” I said to them,
“...yours is the strength of thousands...yours is the strength of the chosen,
the humble and the contrite, the pure and lowly...blessed are the lowly. Be ye
perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tried to express my sincerity, the sincerity that began in
the desert, that has been accumulating, that is, for me, the essence of living.
I tried to speak slowly, measuring each word. By the time I was finished I was
very tired. I was glad to feel Peter’s hand on my arm and hear him ask:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aren’t you hungry?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lamb blundered against my legs and I stooped and picked it
up and held it in my arms, thinking of my humble birth. There was such comfort,
holding it; I felt my strength return. I thought of the stable in Bethlehem.
When I went to see it years ago nothing remained but a watering trough and a
fence. Time had also swept away the star and the Magi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Men, women and children pressed around me, talking,
praising, asking ques­tions. When I put down the lamb it dashed away.
Questions—there is no end to questions. I am glad and yet I am world-weary.
World thoughts oppressed me. The moon was well up before I could get away and
walk to Peter’s; as we bowed our heads at the table someone knocked on the
door.</p>

<p class=SymbolseparatorLessBelow><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=LogEntry>Tishri 21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes people say I am an unhappy man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is not true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For one thing, I like to remember happy experiences, and one
of them was the wedding at Cana. What a pleasant stroll it was, the day
temperate, the path climbing gradually above palm trees of the valley, up to
the vineyards. Birds were gossiping in the vineyards. The blue of the Jordan
flashed through oleanders. The snowy top of Hermon sent out a string of
flamingos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Cana, Mother greeted me. There were old friends among the
guests. Miriam was beautiful, more beautiful than I remembered. I thought of
Solo­mon’s song as I watched her, “Thou art in the clefts of the rock; let me
see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice and thy
countenance is comely...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After we had eaten Mother came to me and said “there is no
more wine... Miriam is distressed...a wedding without wine!” she exclaimed,
gesturing toward the guests at their outdoor tables. Certainly it was Miriam’s
day. I thought of our friendship through the years and I decided to change
water into wine, a token to their youth and their happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I called two of the servants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fill the water pots with water...now empty them into the
wine pitchers. There will be wine for everyone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s good wine,” I heard someone remark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Miriam thanked me and I hoped for acceptance on the part of
everyone. A beginning has been made, perhaps a seal or symbol had been placed
on my min­istry. I tasted the wine on my lips as I walked to Peter’s. Before I
had gone any distance Andrew and Phillip criticized the miracle. They said I
could change a man’s soul as easily. They were afraid. Mother, walking with us,
defended me and ridiculed them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alone, I struck out across a grain field where men were
dismantling a tent; behind a stick fence donkeys brayed; day was closing behind
its fence of clouds; I felt that the men dismantling their tent were also
dismantling time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alone, the happiness of the wedding returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tasted the wine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>ather is too old to work and I want
him to sell one of the Magi gifts, help himself and Mother. This has been a
poor carpentry season for him and for others. No use has been made of the gifts
these years but he won’t listen. He will not so much as hint where they are
stored. Where else but the synagogue? He is afraid of the wealth, of robbers...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to get him started about the Magi. His eyebrow
cocks, his head tilts, he pulls his beard and settles himself, legs crossed. He
describes camels, accoutre­ments, attendants, a long, long story, growing
longer with the years. The star and the angels are always there. He be­comes
eloquent like someone who had dabbled in divination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Casper...Melchior...Balthasar...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mother is pronouncing their names. She is fondest of the
Babylonian king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><sup>“</sup>He was tall and stately and wore a dark blue
robe. His hair and beard were snowy white...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a harsh journey into Egypt, some of the time without
water, the heat so overpowering they walked at night. At an encampment,
Egyptian soldiers provided food while Mother rested a few days. A sergeant
repaired her sandals. They followed an ancient caravan route, asking for help.
They lived with Gabra nomads—borrowing a white camel, a day or two. Father says
“she was a real princess on that camel!” They hid in a hutment from Herod’s
men, his troops passing on maneuvers. A lone traveler gave them dates and
bread. They begged eggs at a caravanserai...a little goat’s milk...a little
meat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mother praised her donkey. He never refused to carry her.
For a while they stopped under sycamores where it was cool, a pond nearby. But
they were very hungry. There, under the trees, the donkey died. They thought
they would never get back to Israel. Father had the Magi gifts sewn to the
donkey’s pad but when the animal died he had to carry everything. Utterly
disheartened, they trudged on. They got lost. There were sand storms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mother begged him to sell the gold cup. “It’s not mine to
sell,” he objected. But he traded Melchior’s coins, “for the sake of our boy.”
So they survived. Herod’s men continued to haunt them; then they learned that
he was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Despicable men do despicable things,” Father said. “Rome is
the great insti­gator of crimes. The <i>Kittim</i>! Political schemes are
hatched in the Forum with the wild beasts. Rome appoints a governor for
Jerusalem; the man is in exile so he devours us, his subjects.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last night I lay awake most of the night, haunted by these
ghosts. The past can be a simoom. Maybe it is a good thing when today’s
problems wipe out yes­terday’s problems. When the oil in the lamp burned out I
tried to find oil in the storage shed. There was no more. At dawn I read my favorite
psalms.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A thousand hoplites marched through our town. Drums. Horns.
Thud of spears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people fled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last month the hoplites caused a riot in Naim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am unable to countenance such hirelings. I am unable to
countenance mili­tary death.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friends are still troubled by my miracle at Cana. As a group
of us walked to Jerusalem their annoyance went on and on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Jerusalem I was annoyed by the bellowing of cattle, the
bleating of sacrifi­cial sheep. An ox screamed. Dust rose from underfoot as I
jostled turbaned men... A woman in a striped veil blocked my way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Passing Herod’s temple I searched for sky. Men had worked
for years to build that temple—was it for dust and smoke?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the temple I stood among money exchange tables and
listened to men haggle. A strange, dark, bestial man lorded over everyone. At
an ivory-topped table men quarreled and spat. A sacrificial trumpet shrilled. I
grabbed my <i>taliss</i>, the one Father gave me. Knotting it into a whip I
struck the money from a table. Coins spun. An exchanger howled. I lashed
another table, upset it, then another. A crowd jeered as I demanded that they
honor the temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is man’s place of worship. You offend God. Look, what
you’re doing... take your money away...you know our temple is sacred. God’s
temple is a temple of peace.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later, when a judge demanded an explanation, I saw my own
disrespect, my own violence. He was a lanky, stone-like figure, grey-haired,
grey-faced, palsied. He understood my rebellion, the rankling perturbations of
my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m a Greek,” he said. “I realize your alienation. I’m new
here. I have much to learn. When a man revolts there is usually well-grounded
reason. But be care­ful! The next time there may be fines or punishment;
another man may not be lenient.”</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Heshvan 9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That night, after scourging the temple, I dreamed of home: I
was working at the carpenter’s bench, making a three-legged stool. I finished
smoothing the legs and sat on the floor, Whitey beside me. She was playing with
a heap of shavings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again I had that illusion that time was mine, that the
sunshine and flies and smell of olive oil and earth would never leave me. And I
thought, as I worked on the stool, how pleased Mother would be when I finished
it for her birthday. I glanced at a mark on the wall and wondered if I had
grown taller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wearing dirty work clothes I was readily admitted into the
prison at Machaerus, a citadel high above the countryside. Guards shrugged as I
entered. A door clanged with a terrible crash: I was in John’s cell. Kissing
me, hugging me, we embraced: as always I felt he was part of me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How are you, cousin? I thought we would never get to see
each other again...in all those rags they didn’t know you. You chose a good
time; there has been an ugly quarrel going on...we have new guards. Here, here,
sit by me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John has been imprisoned five months and is chained to the
wall, a loop around one leg, letting him move a few feet. Rattling the chain,
he nodded and grinned at me. I did not understand what he whispered. When he
was certain we were alone he grasped his chain and forced it open, first one
link and then an­other. Though he had been a wrestler and farmer I was amazed.
Free, he clasped me in his arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a great trick...nobody knows...I can get up at night
and walk around... maybe there’s a way to get out of here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often we have been taken for brothers because of our red
hair; we trim our beards the same way; our faces are much alike except that
mine is leaner. We were brothers as we talked, sitting on the stone floor, the
chain between us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John urged me to leave Capernaum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can’t go on preaching there. Antipas has men on the
lookout for you. He’s as cruel as Herod, you know that! Go in hiding for a
while, Jesus. There’s no good in it if both of us end up in chains. Our
ministry will fail.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had concealed bread and fruit in my clothes but John would
not eat while I was there. I gave him a comb and he combed his beard and head,
grimacing, laughing. I asked him to change clothes with me: “You can put me in
chains,” I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An empty cell, stone walls, chains, the Dead Sea glistening
dozens of feet below, a cold floor, a little food...what could I do? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are there other prisoners on this floor, John?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I never see them... I’m not allowed outside.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know that we are trying to free you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t run any risks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We aren’t afraid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have enough to eat...time to pray.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We need you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He bowed in prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>To be born anew</i>...that is our hope for mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went away embittered. Think of it, I left a comb and some
bread and fruit for a great man, a man of God. As I walked through the night I
heard and re-heard those words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“May the Lord bless thee and keep thee, the Lord make His
face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up His
countenance and give thee peace.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peace inside stone walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When shall John and I meet again?</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Heshvan 19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have preached in the synagogues at Cana and Capernaum
during the last few days. I do not like preaching indoors. The sky is best and
weeds and grass make the best floor. Old laws become new laws outdoors. I
stress repentance and faith—the time is now at hand. I try to speak with
authority and yet avoid rigid precepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Usually I walk alone. Being alone, from time to time, is
essential: there is a peace in the company of one’s own shadow. After every
meeting I am again surrounded by questioners, most of them respectful, some are
quite idle and oblivious of anything but themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Capernaum, as I spoke, swallows flew in and out, swooping
low. I won­dered, as I watched them, are we the interlopers, have we usurped
their place? For me birds epitomize the highest form of beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Near Capernaum I met an officer as I rested under trees
along the road. His horse was lathered with sweat and the man was tired; he
leaned forward in the saddle and eyed me critically, in silence. I asked him to
dismount and rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joining me he said he had heard of my miracle at the wedding
and my cure of the street beggar. He brushed dust off his immaculate uniform.
Wiping his face he scrutinized me, then pled with me to come and heal his son
who was, ac­cording to his doctor, dying of fever. I shared fruit and he
introduced himself; he admitted he had sought me as a last resort. I pitied the
young father, fond of his only child, yet so skeptical. Rising nervously,
catching his horse’s bridle, he urged me to go to his home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can’t wait any longer... You don’t seem to understand
that my son is dying. Ride to Capernaum. Take my horse. Ride...help my boy.
Master, cure him...he has been ill with a terrible fever...for days... I must
find help if you can’t help...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ride home,” I said. “Your son will live; from this very
hour he will improve. Ride home in peace...do not hurry... God has answered
your plea, our prayers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I felt my faith attend the boy as he lay in bed. For a
little while he became my son—the son I would never have. I blessed him. My
faith, God’s grace, would renew the child. My power was adequate. I did not
need to travel to Capernaum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Never looking back, the officer rode off, dubious, angry. A
breeze clattered dry leaves above me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I knelt in prayer.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am troubled because there are so many sick in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Capernaum...Capernaum...the village might be all mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here I healed the mother of my host, a woman gravely ill of
seizures. I had hardly helped her and finished my dinner when people clamored
at the door, the demented as well as the sick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still riding his bay, the officer found me and assured me
his son was recov­ering—his ardent gratitude was so bewildering, so nervous. As
we talked in the courtyard of my host’s home people jostled him. He tried to
send them away, to establish a sense of intimacy with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walking through the town at dusk I touched this one, spoke
to another. A sense of anonymity troubled me: it was everywhere. The exultant
friends, the overjoyed crowd, forced me to retreat. As I closed the door of the
house I ob­served Roman soldiers. I asked to be left alone. I ate supper alone.
Early in the morning, shortly after dawn, I slipped away to the hills.</p>

<p class=SymbolseparatorLessBelow><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=LogEntry>Peter’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simeon came. We sat on stools and he thanked me, tears in his
eyes. Clean, wearing new clothes, a little shawl around him, he related how
thrilling it was to be able to move about, to “really walk.” He explained what
it had been to be “a stone in the street, a stone to spit on.” Eyes burning, he
made me know what it was to be forsaken, abused, hungry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He says he has told others of his cure. Only a few mockers
doubt. Friends and strangers visit his house, to touch him. He imitated poking
hands. Simeon is a pathetically handsome man, still frail, his frailty
accenting his features. “My cousin Ephriam has promised me a job,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m fifty-three but you’ve made me young. My memory is
coming back. Everything tastes good...”</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe my faith will help people because it is a faith of
hope, a faith that conquers obstacles; it is a faith based on patience and
kindness. We have no right to kill, no right to inflict pain. Ours is the gift
of understanding, contentment. Ours is the honoring of simplicity and honesty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sun on the hills is a kind of faith...the vineyard that
endures is another...the wounded heron struggling on...childbirth
pain...fishermen drying their nets on the beach...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Our Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is our guide, Father of us all, brother of us all, master
of all. Seek and you will find. Our kingdom is at hand.</p>

words. I detect the difference in just a month or so. I am encour­aged. I no
longer have to think what I do with my hands and arms, how I stand. Thoughts
flow.</p>

has been beaten by his guards. Several times I have returned to Capernaum to
visit Joseph, the young officer. He has promised to use his influence to free John.
How wary he is of becoming involved with the prison authorities. In Jerusalem
my intercessions are ridiculed: John is branded treasonous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Authorities are evasive or antagonistic. They ridicule our
wish to uplift the world. I am told to take care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Guards at the citadel refused to allow me to visit John.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Conception. Birth. Death. Each is a mystery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my father’s house I grew up among mysteries. I heard them
talked, argued over, curtly dismissed. I have resented the unknowns, yet to
plumb them is still beyond me. Each child is a mystery. The temple is a
mystery. The shell that I pick up on the beach has its mystery. Some say I am a
man of mysteries. Does the turtle have its mysteries?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For days I have been too busy and preoccupied to
write—preaching often, healing often. I am writing in a borrowed tent; James
and Mark are asleep inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, on the lake shore, I was circled by a crowd. I
talked to them till late. I wish to record the promises I made them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=QuoteIndent0 style='text-indent:0in'>Verily, I say unto you, he that
believeth in me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers
ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead. I am living bread. If any man eat of
this bread he shall live forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In keeping with my promise I passed out bread and fish in
baskets. I blessed the food and there was an abundance for everyone, many of
them hungry chil­dren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark and James and Phillip passed the baskets till each was
fed, the fish and bread always sufficient. At parting I reminded the people of
the deeper meaning but some were overwhelmed by the miracle. A youngster ran
about shouting: “He made the bread...he made the fish...with his own hands.
Jesus made...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A strange restlessness troubled almost everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Phillip, Andrew and I strolled along a white path, as white,
in the moonlight, as if made of crushed shells. Galilee was flat and silvery.
Andrew continued to comment about the “bread and fish” at almost every turn of
the path. His youth­ful, enthusiastic face warned me, warned me that youth is
irresponsible. What is the proper age for wisdom? As for miracles is there a
miracle surpassing the miracle of faith?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter has made me a tent. It is dark green, and big enough
for two. The tent pole is an antique shepherd’s staff. A charioteer and a
number of untranslatable characters have been carved on the wood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Papa gave me that staff long ago. He said it is Assyrian.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can carry the tent comfortably and the staff is never out

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t cut me down,” I begged. “I am shade...I am the home

<p class=MsoNormal>John is dead. Murdered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He has been beheaded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world has lost a voice of reason. I have lost my best
friend. He was be­headed at a drunken orgy—his head was displayed like a trophy
at the palace. What desecration, abuse, folly, horror. I can barely
write...sorrow...resentment... my mind whirls to the days we passed together in
the desert, our wilderness comradeship. His faith was my faith. Our bonds were
those of true brotherhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should have been able to free him. Instead I gave him
dried fruit and a comb. The letters I wrote did nothing. My petitions were
disregarded. I was too patient. I have sat in this room all day...nothing has
come of my sorrow but more sorrow. Peter and James and Mark have had their say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Late in the evening friends arrived, wanting to plan his
burial. Permission has been granted: we are to be permitted to claim his body.
It is best to have the sacred privilege of farewell. We tell each other that we
must succeed for his sake, man of poverty, prison and death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For his sake we can burn our lamps and candles and share
late communion, get up early, walk many leagues and extol his faith. We will
tell it on the hills and in the towns and in the villages. I feel his
wrestler’s hand tighten on my shoulder.</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Kislev 12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We brought John to the ancient rocky crypts, a dozen of us.
Some of us wound scarves around our faces. Mother suspected that we were
followed. She insisted on two to act as guards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simon was there... Matthew, Peter, Luke, Mark...they helped
us lay John out­side his crypt, helped us cut stone. A torch burned Mark’s arm;
someone smashed our hammer. “Work fast,” someone was constantly urging. Peter
got defiant: “Let the Romans come,” he shouted. “We have a right to bury our
dead.” Luke had to calm him. It was dawn before we had the crypt sealed; we
were cut and bruised. No torches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I sat among the cliff rocks I tried to obliterate the
tragedy, tried to refute his death. Hard to breathe. Hard to utter the final
prayer. Think of it...we had buried a headless man, friend, friend...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we stole into town we met the <i>Kittim</i> officer,
riding for Capernaum; he did not recognize me of course. What a stark figure! I
wanted to talk to him about his son but Mother begged me: we must not trust him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She railed against wickedness and power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luke left us, to care for a sick man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we walked, Mother leaned on a stick. Her wrinkled face
made me aware that the star of long ago was not around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Matthew’s home we talked of John’s betrayal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps we should be somewhat mad to combat man’s madness:
we must chop up the two thousand crucifixes, chop them into pieces for firewood
and with that firewood we shall bake our bread—our <i>pita</i>. Crucified bread
is the bread of the poor, the waiting, waiting poor. God must help them; we
must help them; we must help them as we must help God. Heal. Lift up our eyes.</p>

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Nazareth—home</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Kislev 20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I picked corn in a field with my disciples I was
reproved because it was Sunday. When I healed the withered arm of a man I was
rebuked because it was Sunday. I am threatened by various authorities for such
“misdemeanors.” Men spy on me and plot against me for acts of kindness.
Kindness has reached the level of a crime. Officials remind me, rather
discreetly, that John met a tragic death. The Sadducees hate me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the pool of Bethseda I helped a man who could not get
into the water: I brought him health. He had been a paralytic for years. A cry
went up because this was on a feast day. I explained that I intended to carry
out my work regardless of the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The son of man is lord even on the Sabbath,” I said. “The
world of kind­ness must be a part of our world.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Nazareth, as I preached on a hill, the crowd turned on
me. They insisted I perform miracles for them. Angered that I would not respond
willy-nilly, men attempted to throw me off the cliffside of the hill. James,
Mark and Phillip pro­tected me; the four of us climbed down the cliff to a
wadi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Disgusted, Father feels I have gone out of my mind. He longs
for the peace of my boyhood days. Mother understands: her feeling is intuitive.
Though I dis­appoint and worry her she hides her concern, offering
encouragement. She visits those I have healed and tells me how they have
changed. Not all are like Simeon, grateful. Some do not want to have anything
to do with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I write Peter leans over my shoulder, reading this record
that is such a poor record. In the midst of my writing I see John’s face; I
hear him. We talk about him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Romans are going to take you, one of these days! What
can I do to look after you? All of us...what can we do? Look at that madman the
other day. He rushed at you... I thought he would kill you...he had a knife.
And you cured his madness. There...there, he became one of us...or so it seems.
Luke wants to help me look after you. You can’t go on without any thought for
yourself!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter’s voice expresses sincerity, warmth, education. Speech
is man’s finest quality. More than the eyes, the smile. Its powers are almost
limitless. Its tender­ness, the child, the babe. My mother consoles with a word
perhaps. Out of the past it goes on and on with its revelations, its mirages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter crumples leaves in his hands and reminisces as we sit
around a table, the door open, his dog lying outside, flumping his tail
agreeably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“...No, Papa wasn’t a clever fisherman. When Mama died he
didn’t look after our house; it didn’t much matter to him what we had to eat.
He seemed to be looking for her. I tried to light his lamp but it didn’t work.
He got very thin, weak; he coughed. I did all the fishing for us. I provided
but I didn’t do a very good job... I miss him...it was good to have him there,
even when he was sick...”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='text-indent:0in'>n this little, comfortable house
I try to find time in the evenings to study Greek or write in my journal. I
prefer my journal. Doors wide open, the lamp bright, I read or write. My legs
get restless, my eyes blink and the next thing I know the lamp has burned out
and my room is dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other night, after tossing on my pallet, I dreamed that
a woman came and brought an antique alabaster box and knelt beside me—to anoint
my feet. I tried to say something to her but I couldn’t speak. The woman was
beautiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly I was standing on a hill. A man was near me; there
was nobody else. The man began repeating a parable, imitating me, each word
curiously vivid. He said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There was a creditor who had two debtors. One owed his
master five hun­dred but the other owed fifty.” The speaker stopped, adjusted
his purple robe. “When their master forgave them their debts who was the most
grateful? The one who owed the most or the one who owed less?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Someone laughed uproariously.</p>

written. Pen strokes. Such a frail thing, this wisdom.</p>

I have trudged along the shore at Galilee; I have listened to the waves and

peered at the stars. I have repeated scriptures. Talked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A storm woke me as I lay in my tent. The wind was churning
leaves and I walked to the lake to watch the waves. I felt cold but pulled my
cloak around me and continued walking. Clouds were traveling fast. When the
rain started I re­traced my steps. I heard voices and men at their oars. Waves
were piling against rocks. The voices in the boat sounded familiar. Again the
thud of oars. Yells. Wasn’t that Phillip? It was Peter. Through rain and spray
I made out the hull of the boat; then I recalled someone saying they had to
land a catch before dawn. Someone shouted:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’re sinking...we’re sinking!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I walked over the water toward the boat; it was difficult to
see through the rain and spray. I recognized the boat. As I walked the waves
calmed; the water was black underfoot. Two of our men had slumped over their
oars. I shouted. Nobody responded: they were frightened at seeing me. Peter
cowered. I called again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Peter,” I cried. “ Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is it you, Jesus?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let me come to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come,” I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sank as he walked toward me and I caught his arm and
steadied him and helped him climb into his boat. Luke welcomed me. The boat
swung toward me and I got in and sat at the stern with Phillip. Everyone began
bailing. The rain was letting up and I pointed to the shore. We soon beached
her and everyone began to talk, telling his panic, that they had been unable to
see; they crowded around me; they thought I had saved their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luke built a fire of beachwood and as the sun came up we had
breakfast to­gether—some of them singing, everyone hungry, the fish tasting
marvelous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mark broke his oar,” Luke said and laughed. He was drying
by the fire, his clothes steaming. He explained that they had been blown first
one way and then another.</p>

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Nain</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Tevet 18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been a beautiful week because I raised a man from
the dead and made a blind man see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Nain, a small village, my disciples and I met a burial
procession headed for tombs cut in the side of a nearby hill. A young man lay
on a flower-covered bier. I learned his name from a man in the procession: it
was David. He and his mother had been my friends for years. I recognized
Athalia walking behind the bier, weeping. Aaron, her husband, had died
recently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a warm, still afternoon. The warbling of a bulbul seemed
out of place as the procession passed. As the bier scraped against a rock, as
the bearers stopped, I approached one of them and asked them to wait.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“David...David...this is Jesus...arise...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The disciples, astonished, bunched around the bier. I
touched David, spoke loudly, shook him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“David, you are all right. Your mother is here. Get up...”
He sat up among his flowers and his mother rushed to his side. He recognized my
voice and asked for me. I talked gently with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A happy procession. The bier was abandoned; someone threw
flowers into the air as David walked...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am overjoyed as I write. I see David and his mother
kissing each other. Someone is singing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From Nain I went on to see the daughter of Jairus as she lay
in bed in her home. The curtains were drawn; the air was sick room air; flowers
had wilted on her bed table; her dog cringed under her bed. I asked everyone to
leave us alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>Talitha cumi</i>,” I said. “Daughter, I say arise...you
are no longer ill. The fever has left you.” As I prayed I also thought of John
and his death. This little girl was not to fill a grave. I bent over her and
took her hand. I could see her rolling a hoop, laughing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>Talitha cumi</i>,” I repeated, and sat beside her,
pressed my hand over her fore­head, touched her eyelids. “Rise, my
daughter...you must sleep no longer...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her eyes flashed; she was afraid because she had never seen
me; smiling, I said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your mother is outside your room...shall I call her?” She
nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I came to the blind man in his home I pressed my fingers
over his eyes and spoke to him. I wet clay and placed it over his eyes. I
allowed the cool clay to comfort him as I spoke; his wife watched with an
expression of doubt; as I removed the clay she stepped aside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He made a curious noise, pushed me aside, stood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walking, he asked:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>s a boy I respected Greek—such a
rich vocabulary, I found; I thought the language overly concise. Hebrew is the
city man’s tongue, best suited to argument. I prefer my Aramaic. It is more
gracious and agreeable for public speaking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Haran believed in learning three languages: he was the most
intelligent rabbi I have met. To him I owe my background; his years of tutoring
gave me freedom to think. Morning after morning we sat facing each other at his
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have to think, not memorize...you memorize and then
force memories to evolve into patterns of original thought. Yes, memory and
thought are broth­ers. But, make no mistake, thousands repeat the law and the
scriptures and only a handful think.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I see his sparsely bearded, wan face. He was a man who ate
sparingly yet lived to be eighty. A great walker, he was as restless in body as
in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Haran was proud of two ancient scrolls—one of them on
copper. The library at Qumran had greater rarities of course. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Haran said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Something lives in you...your mother has called my
attention to it, an inner voice. When I heard you declaim in the synagogue I
perceived it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it is my privilege to help, merge dream and fulfillment:
I believe it is a privilege no other man has had: I am the husbandman.</p>

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Tent</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Shevat 12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Years ago I experienced the greatness of the Sinai desert,
its crags and dunes, the heat and cold. I came to understand its desolation,
its loneliness, its calm and fury. Now, during these troubled times, I long to
return to the Sinai...have a lizard sit beside me, my straw-covered basket
filled with golden dates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Sinai I perfected my Greek to a greater extent and
studied the classical Hebrew until it came easily. The history of man became an
important part of my meditations. Silence and the simoom became part of those
devotions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tiny plant sprouted outside my tent and withstood the
heat, cold and winds. It was my companion and incentive, a little calendar in
leaves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I found the same plant growing at Qumran, behind the
monastery. While I studied there it survived several sand storms.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Locusts, dates, bread, honey—the wilderness taught me the
true taste of food. During the months since the wilderness I have eaten well,
too well, but the taste is lacking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have not thought as clearly as I thought when unencumbered
by men. There, each morning was mine, each evening was mine. Worship was as
natural as breathing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My tent flaps billowed. They were pinned back every night by
the stars. Heat and thirst were often there yet a sense of praise was foremost.
Wonderment was on top of a dune. As I slept a mirage might come and bathe me in
its cool water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I slept on my boyhood blanket, one woven by my mother. She
wove it when I was ten.</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Shevat 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am leaving Nazareth—leaving home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is farewell to friends and places, all I have loved. Only
in memory will I walk along the orchard creek and hunt for crayfish, think and
stare as a boy thinks and stares. I had several pals... We had niches in cliffs
where we often hid. We had an old fig we liked to climb; there was a cave where
we lit fires. We found menhirs and dolmen—strange, strange things! In Galilee
we had a stout little boat and we’d drift, drop anchor, fish for chromis and
watch the pelicans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There’s a feeling to my Nazareth: the stars are brighter
there, the sun seems a little bigger, the wind a little cooler. How good it was
to turn a corner and think: Mama’s home...supper is almost ready...Papa’s
working in his shop.</p>

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Nazareth</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Shevat 20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today was cool and windy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I visited Simeon. I visited Mark. I visited Jude. I called
on the captain, who has been transferred to Nazareth. His son sat in my lap a
while. I did not say good-bye although I lingered at each place. I wanted to
feel the peace of each place and keep it with me. I did not need to talk much.
Being with friends was all I asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oh, how the wind blew me along, flapping my cloak, flapping
the olive branches, the weeds and the papyrus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How hard it is to write.</p>

<p class=SymbolseparatorLessBelow><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=LogEntry>Nazareth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before I left home Father displayed the gifts of the Magi on
his work bench, first removing his tools and shavings. He locked the door and
lit two candles. Mother—so excited—seemed to be seeing the star as she handled
the gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They haven’t changed... Joseph, you’ve taken good care of
them! Oh, they’re so beautiful!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And she knelt in the sawdust, the gold cup in her hands, its
jewels redder than I had remembered. I had forgotten the gifts were so
beautiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where have you kept them...in the synagogue? The geniza?” I
asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father nodded, frowning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We have decided to present them to the
elders...tomorrow...at the meeting. They’ll become the temple possessions. It’s
different with you going away... Mother and I have decided...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I wasn’t listening; I was absorbed in Mother’s
appreciation as she han­dled the gifts, kneeling or half-kneeling, smiling; her
shoulders lost some of their age. The myrrh box interested me, its aroma still
evident, its chased lid yet untar­nished. Mother lifted the clasp. The clasp
was set with green stones. She called my attention to the ornamented hinges.
She held out the gold cup to my father...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I wish you hadn’t worried about the gifts,” she said with a
sigh. “We ought to have enjoyed them...now we can see them at the temple...
Look, Jesus, at this handle...ah, those were strange days in Bethlehem... God
was with us...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I loved her for her dreams and sacrifices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I loved the hints of youth and beauty in her face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tomorrow is my last day here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I lay on my pallet I heard rain lash our roof; I heard
the wind in the trees. Then my mind dropped back and I remembered Mother
singing, crooning to me, as I lay sick as a boy. I remembered songs in the
evening. I heard her laugh­ter as we played jacks. I smelled her barley
bread... I smelled roasting lamb... Father was in his workshop, his plane
sliding; he was singing. As a child I loved his singing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, silent, worried, he works in a preoccupied state,
bothered by frequent visitors, concerned about my future. “It is wrong of you
to go to Jerusalem, wrong to throw yourself into the hands of your enemies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There will be no more Festivals of Light.</p>

<p class=MsoFooter>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I walked into Jerusalem I heard those words. It was dusk.
An immense caravan choked the air, camels, drivers, gapers. Again I thought of
Herod and the innocents: city life brings Herod to mind. The <i>Kittim </i>are
evident on the main streets: helmets, standards, shields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=133 height=216

hspace=12>A camel sank to the ground beside me, eying me, begging for kindness.
Trumpets blared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crowds circled the temple, some chanting, some bearing
fruit, some waving palm fronds. Flares burned. On two giant candelabra, perhaps
eighty feet high, torches smoked, guttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shall I be able to help the people of Jerusalem? Shall I
remain? My loneliness here was so unlike the loneliness of the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was to meet Judas who was to take me to friends. When he
did not come I bedded down in a booth of branches, with cattle nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I slept and woke to their animal sounds, without dread.
Someone roused the oxen, then the sheep; the beasts wanted to be fed and
watered. Nobody dis­turbed me. Probably I was considered a herdsman. I dreamed
until a child brought me a cup of water: holding it out prettily she asked:
“Are you thirsty?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” I said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My papa is taking care of the oxen.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Opening my pouch I offered sugared dates to the girl.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=TOCChapter style='margin-top:0in'><span style='font-variant:normal !important'>I
found Judas at the home of a mutual friend. I had never seen him so well
dressed. He drew me aside and gave me money from our treasury. He seemed
forlorn. I am told he is having a love affair with the daughter of Pilate.
Marcus, the son of a senator, has described Pilate’s daughter as a beautiful,
talented, ruthless woman. Marcus and I sat on a garden bench and he enthused
about Jerusalem: “So unlike Rome, so much more oriental—can it be we are free
of our penates here?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That evening I stayed in the house of Leonidas Clibus. My
windows were olive tree windows. Garden paths circled a tiny fountain where
someone had tossed fresh oleander blossoms, red blossoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A copy of Horace lay on a circular table by my bed; lamps
and rugs, hangings and x-shaped Roman chairs, cushions and inlaid boxes
brightened the room. Propped on a cushion I read Horace for hours; when my
candles dimmed a slave brought me fresh candles and volumes by Lucretius—recent
translations.</p>

<p class=Poem>We turn and turn in the same atmosphere...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I went to sleep preferring the thoughts of Horace: his love
of nature, his fondness for rustic surroundings, his boating on the river
Aufidus, his fishing. He liked to play ball. I could visualize him, as a boy,
when wood pigeons covered him with leaves as he slept on a hillside.</p>

priceless looks they give. I love their delight in simple things, their warmth,
their trust, so obvious, so quick. Truly, theirs is a special kingdom. I am
happiest when they are around me, as they were yester­day in Clibus’ garden. It
was a birthday party for his daughter who is six. I told stories as they sat
around me. What laughter, giggles. A little boy brought me a toad and put it in

<p class=MsoNormal>A delicate bronze of Minerva stands on a plinth at the

<p class=LogEntry>Adar 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I spoke to a group near the city gate. I was aware that
officials were present, Sadducees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I saw men dragging a woman, kicking her, letting her fall.
She had been caught in adultery. When she was brought to me I suspected a
trick. Why should I pass judgment when officials were in the crowd? Authorities
wanted me to break the law by passing judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was shocked by the woman’s fear, her beseeching face. As
she stood by me a soldier hit her with a chain. Men yelled: “Stone her, stone
her!” When a man shoved her to her knees she hid her face in her arms—pretty, a
country girl, I thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To give myself time to think I wrote on the ground with a
stick. I wrote and obliterated words, watching the crowd and the woman. I
smelled death. It was in the smoke of sacrifices burning in the city. It was in
the crowd around me. I had never smelled the death of a person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taking in the street ruffians and the officials I said, in a
loud voice:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look at her, at her torn clothes. Do any of you know her?
Think. Go deep inside. Think. Let the man who has not sinned throw the first
stone. You accuse her...where is the man? Go home, all of you. Have you no
pity? Remember the commandment: Thou shalt not kill. We are not animals! Let
her go... I repeat, let her go. Go home—all of you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I helped the woman to stand. Someone had thrown ashes on her
face and I bought water at a shop and washed her face and hands and bought oil
for her cuts and bruises. Matthew found us and brought her food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where can I hide?” she asked us. “What is to become of me?
They will catch me...beat me... Master, master...what shall I do?” Her words
mixed with sobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Matthew and I helped her out of town, beyond the gates. We
sent her to the home of Talus where Luke cares for the sick.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I returned to Clibus’ library but I was too disturbed to
read. While I sat there, the <i>Sayings of Moses </i>spread before me, Affti,
Clibus’ Egyptian wife, brought a pillow and sat by me. She is as beautiful as
Miriam; to have her there was a com­fort but her words were not comforting:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It isn’t safe for you to preach in Jerusalem... Your faith
is for the little towns and villages where the Romans have less influence or
none at all...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When James was here a month or so ago he mentioned going to
Rome. Do you wish him to preach your gospel there?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She went on to urge me to send apostles to Egypt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There are more than seventy of you now... I hope you can
send two or more to my country...to preach in the villages...you are needed
there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That evening, after dinner, she rapped on my door: she is
very tall, very ele­gant; dressed in an Egyptian gown, she made a little bow,
and presented me with a bronze stylus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It will be better than your wooden one,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While enjoying my stylus someone brought me a dish of lemon
paste.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sadly, more than twenty years have passed since our Nazareth
synagogue ac­quired a scroll. Our scrolls are in tatters and all are asked to
refrain from using them. Learning this, Clibus has offered several scrolls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll send two of my men...one to carry the scrolls, the

Then, stunning everyone, authorities questioned me rudely. Because he defended
me and called me his healer he was put in jail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had to go before the local magistrate, affirm his honesty;

all in rags. All were afraid of me, afraid of themselves. I thought I could
change their minds but their minds were in tatters like their clothes. One man
thanked me, a young man from Tyre; the others, quarrelling, pushing one
another, tearing at their rags, left the road to crawl into a cave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I asked the man from Tyre what he knew about the others but
he could not concentrate on what I said: he was so moved, so pleased, so
enraptured over his health he stood in front of me, smiling, laughing. He kept
holding up his arms and hands—showing me. I asked him about people I knew in
Tyre. He shook his head, laughed, kissed my hands, rushed off. A caravan was
passing, camels, drivers, onlookers; he disappeared among the camels, the dust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am no longer in accord with Qumran’s rigid communal life:

<p class=MsoNormal>I spoke outside the temple and, as I spoke, men and boys
picked up stones to throw at me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sadducees want me excluded from the temple; others want me
excommuni­cated. They stamp me an untouchable. Such intrigue! How am I to help
man­kind? My disciples urge me to leave Jerusalem. The world is beautiful, they
remind me: Go to Cana, go to Bethlehem, to Galilee, to Jericho. Date groves.
Olive groves. Roses. As if I needed a reminder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This afternoon I walked about Solomon’s city to an
impressive ruin, a series of roofless rooms, fallen columns, weeds growing
through marble floors, lizards on walls. Birds dotted the sky. I tried to
imagine the regal furnishings of Ptolemy’s time. Underfoot were hieroglyphic
slabs, a cartouche among them. I climbed old stone walls, were they Nehemiah’s
walls when he fortified the city? I found a broken scarab and remembered
Egyptian words my mother taught me as a boy. In the street below the vast ruins
a Roman soldier talked with another Roman soldier. Herod’s workmen were capping
stone pillars. Tall men in dark red robes, red turbans on their heads, prodded
camels, heavily laden animals. Were they Syrians?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Somewhere along the way I met a blind man led by a boy. The sun
sent sweat down the boy’s face. Tired, they sat by a spring where women and
girls were filling jars. People recognized me and soon a crowd formed, as I
rested. The blind man, wearing a sash woven with gold, white-bearded, tall,
erect and proud, asked about me. The boy whispered desperately to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s Bartimaeus and his son, from Jericho,” a woman said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Son of David, have mercy on me,” Bartimaeus pled, speaking
softly. Then he cried:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lord, have mercy, that I may receive my sight. Are you
Jesus of Nazareth? Will you help me? Will you touch my eyes? I must see again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sat close to him and talked to him, the aura of his faith
evident. As we talked I realized he could see: his expressions were so
startling. He embraced his son. Erect, silent, he stared about him. Everyone
was silent. Fumbling a little, he walked away; then, he returned and knelt by
me and kissed my hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Master...let me follow you... I believe...let me be one of
your chosen...let me tell others what you have done for me. I know about your
ministry.” He kissed my robe. “When I heard you speak yesterday I tried to
reach you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He urged me to stay at his home; perhaps he had heard me say
that fox have holes and birds have nests but the man of God has no home. I
warned Barti­maeus not to look back if he put his hand to the plough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lately I have not seen much of Judas. He refuses to visit me
at Clibus’ home. I hear that Judas has quarrelled with the daughter of Pilate.

<p class=MsoNormal>Through Clibus I have written a letter home. Mother will

They dislike the city. Father has been unable to work and needs to husband his

<p class=MsoNormal>Getting up at dawn I have been able to memorize lines from
Horace, lines that help. The tiny garden helps. The children help. But when
John’s cousin, Elihu, came, distortion returned as we talked of John’s
imprisonment, torture, death. Elihu is a frail soul, so unlike John. He is so
in need of encouragement. He tells me that a storm flooded homes in Nazareth.
They did the best they could with shovels and baskets.</p>

promise of resurrec­tion sustains me although I am, at times, con­fused,
confused because resur­rection means a blurring of the future, perhaps a

<p class=MsoNormal>I must warn myself of the onslaught of pain that will crush me

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, in this city of rocks, I noticed straw in a

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Bethany</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Nisan 12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday I walked to Bethany. Martha and Mary said that
Lazarus had died. Among graves and stunted trees, in a stinging wind, I became
keenly aware of the days I spent at their home, with the three of them. How
often Lazarus and I had done carpentering under his thatched shed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, with his sisters, friends and relatives, here at the tombs,
I knew death was not the answer. I walked to the crypt where Lazarus lay. Loose
rocks tum­bled underfoot. Wind whipped. A boulder blocked the crypt and I asked
Martha to have her friends help me drag it aside. Men consulted and argued that
it was useless; they glared at me savagely as they pushed and dragged the
stone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the opening I bent over and cried:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lazarus...come... I am the resurrection and the
life...come...this is Jesus!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I needed him. His family needed him. Mary and Martha. Death
did not need him, surely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Men jeered and howled. But I knelt and shouted as the wind
spat on all of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ah, sorrowing women, yellow rocks, death, a man in his
crypt, cold stone, a hawk screaming...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I called again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lazarus, this is Jesus. Arise! Come with us! Remember us,
remember I am the resurrection and the life. Come unto me...believe...God is
here...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was late afternoon: the sun was behind the yellow cliff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Martha clutched my arm and said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lord, let us leave. Lazarus has been dead four days. He
stinks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A funeral procession passed by—men and women—the men
carrying a child’s coffin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“God, our Father, help us. Give this man life again!” I
beseeched with pas­sion. I knew, as I prayed, that Lazarus would respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Swaying, wrapped in burial clothes, Lazarus appeared, a
scarf across his face. He could not see or move his hands. I went to him and
Martha uncovered his eyes. Mary ran to help. We unwrapped his legs and arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jesus has given you life,” Martha said. “You are going home
with us...you are one of us again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stumbling over rocks, Mary guiding him, Lazarus found a
place to sit down. We unbound him and someone gave him a robe. Someone offered
him a piece of bread. He shook his head, stared at us, turned from one to the
other, his face birdlike, hawklike, white. He peered at his crypt. Martha
hugged him, laughing. People gathered. Some knelt around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mary, what happened?” Lazarus began, speaking his first
words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why am I here in this place? Why am I wearing a robe? And
these people... and Jesus! Was I sick? Where are my clothes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I longed to leave this place of death: it was closing in on
me. The wind blew harder and a hawk leaped upward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Martha I walked away, listening to her happiness, her
praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We must have supper. What shall we eat? Will he be hungry,
able to eat? Je­sus, you have saved him. I love you. It’s wonderful! He’s back...think
of it, after four days. Then, then there is no death for us who believe...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At supper Lazarus was unable to talk; he drank a little and
soon had bread wet with olive oil. No one had much to say. Lazarus sat next to me.
Bending over his plate he gave me a few boyish grins—like old times. He had
gotten into his work clothes. Putting his hand into a pocket he pulled out a
small chisel and laid it on the table. But he said nothing. I urged him to eat
Martha’s fish or lamb, delicately prepared. Every face at the table expressed a
wonderment and rapture. The candles burned down. The women ate. Suddenly there
was chatter and then laughter—rejoicing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was difficult to return to Jerusalem, leave my friends. I
lingered a day for the fields of barley, the paths that were peaceful paths. I
had to have time to be with Lazarus, be with Mary and Martha, write my journal.
Alongside the carpen­try bench I have a table. I prefer writing outdoors. There
is a vine on the thatched shed and it is in flower. As I write Lazarus is
sleeping on the ground, in the sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I keep hearing the words of an old hymn as I go about; it

<p class=MsoNormal>I seem to hear John’s commanding voice, his loving

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Ephraim</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Nisan 14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am staying at a beautiful old stone house in nearby Ephraim.
I have allowed myself a respite, among pomegranate, olives, roses. Herons fly
at dawn and eve­ning. Children run in and out. A boy with shaggy head has a pet
dove. A girl with almond eyes is learning to weave. My disciples are here, the
new and the old. We have met in a low room, plain and bearded men, clothes new
and disheveled; Ezra shows me his injured leg; Luke works over it; Lamech (a strong
youth) is from Casarea, an expert swimmer, he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I will walk to Jerusalem tomorrow. I’ll remain there. The
high priests will accost me. They may mock and scourge me, as they have many others...but
I will return.” I tried to speak calmly. I could not be forthright...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Calling me “Rabboni,” a pretty girl knelt in the jammed room
and anointed me with fragrant oil. It was a moment of calm, a moment of beauty.</p>

<p class=SymbolseparatorLessBelow><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=LogEntry>Nisan 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Week has begun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I walk accompanied by my disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we pass a tall wooden cross I remembered that the Romans
have crucified as many as two thousand men at one time because of religious
dedication. Al­most every single one of us has witnessed a crucifixion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hail Caesar!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ours was a solemn path on a clear morning, larks singing,
the air brisk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carrying fronds, waving, hoping to speak to us, hundreds
filled the paths and streets, wanting the miracle of love and life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our path crooked upward to the “House of the Figs,” where I
was given a donkey, a tall, white one. Children shouted joyously. For me, he
was my donkey of peace. I waved as I rode along. Some women cut branches and tossed
them in front of me. Others threw flowers and shouted “Hosanna.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jerusalem spread around me, blocks of stone, yellow walls,
piles of ancient masonry, new porticos, towers, shops... It was my city, my
hated city; I esteemed the meaning it has for my forefathers, men who slept in
the valley, with peaked cypresses above their graves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dust fanned over us as we followed a narrow way. Romans turned
on me and turned on the crowd but I warned them to desist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the temple I found more money changers. The courtyard was
cattleyard; waiting rooms were storerooms. Animals bellowed. I struck again at
the vendors, toppling tables, hurling money trays. The crowd screamed, cheered.
In the midst of this bedlam strangers, travelers, stopped Philip and Andrew.
They insisted upon being presented to me. The four men offered me sanctuary in
the kingdom of Edessa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Priests, soldiers, young and old crammed around me as I
explained the life eternal, the image of redemption, eternal salvation and the
price we must pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is our Father...the world of nature proclaims His
goodness...men must share His divine harmony...you reach God from
within...reborn, you recognize the light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Children sang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My love went to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Astride my donkey I preached to them in simple words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the sun slipped behind the city towers there were scores
listening and we lingered on the terrace:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There is light for you for a little while longer...walk
while there is light... darkness will come...he who walks in darkness cannot
tell where he is going... believe in the light...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evening air was becoming chilly; a wind was blowing in
from the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With my twelve I walked through the Golden Gate, passing
great herds of sheep and goats, grey pastoral sheep and black mountain goats. I
was proud of my men, proud of their courage and love, proud of their humility.</p>

<p class=SymbolseparatorLessBelow><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Jerusalem</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Nisan 29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We met in an upper room—a white-walled room. Centering it
was a long ta­ble and we sat around it, sharing bread and wine...below us roses
were in flower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God was with me as I told them, my legatees, that I must
die.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tonight you are entrusted with the keys of the kingdom. Two
at a time you are to go about the world, preaching the gospel. Faith is our
church.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I loved each man. Such faces! Bartholomew, Matthew, Luke,
James, Simon, Peter, Thaddeus, Judas, John, Phillip. I gazed at one and then
the other, fisher­man, cobbler, farmer, physician, lawyer...brothers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your task is to save mankind!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lamps on our table shaped shadows on the walls, on the
floor, far more than shadows. The white walls enshrined each of us. When the
wind puffed our lamps blinked. Ours was an aura that may never recur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Soon my enemies will crucify me...one of you will betray
me...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What consternation! What hysterical exclamations! What
accusations! Then the pleas began: you must escape! Let us help you! We can!
Listen...flee...tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Faith is the miracle for everyone,” I said. “Heal the sick.
Remember Cana... Galilee...Lazarus...the lepers on the roadway...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I reminded them that we are samaritans. Mercy is ours, ours
to give. We are to help the heavy laden. Love our children. We are to teach by
example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel, I told myself, you are to nurture goodwill,
tolerance, peace, hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it was in that white room, at that hour.</p>

<p class=SymbolseparatorLessBelow><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=LogEntry>Clibus’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the light of candles I write, to shepherd words, to commune
once more. There is little time for writing, little time for thinking. I feel
that I must endure. By the flickering lights I commune with Father, Mother,
earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to go on healing the sick, alleviating pain, the
body’s pain, the soul’s. To be a good shepherd, yes. Will my disciples
persevere?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can write no more tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>h, Jerusalem, you killer of prophets,
stoner of those sent to help you! How I have wanted to care for your children
as a hen cares for her chicks under her wings. You would not have me!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Plotters have attempted to trap me. A group cornered me near
the temple. Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar? they asked. I asked for a
coin. I called their attention to the face on the coin, the face of Caesar
Augustus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God
the things that are God’s.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not to be defeated, men queried me, as I sat in the court of
the temple, old, old questions. It seemed to me they were stunned when I reminded
them that God is not the god of the dead but of the living. Other interrogators
appeared at noon. A huge grey-bearded priest demanded:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Master, which is the greatest commandment of the law?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I deliberated, wanting to impose on his arrogance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You shall love the Lord will all your heart and with your
soul and with your mind...this is the first and greatest commandment,” I said.
“The second commandment is similar,” I pointed out. “You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By now I was angry and left these idlers and when I was
alone with my disci­ples I shamed the trouble-makers who clean the outside of
the cup and leave the inside dirty... I called them a generation of
vipers...they are the ones who will persecute the faithful from town to
town...crucify them...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grief overcame me. I could talk no longer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Disgusted with the day, Matthew asked if the world would
come to an end soon. That question had to be left unanswered. Inventors of
questions are every­where. I wanted to add, watch, be on guard, pray ceaselessly,
work... Don’t be careless while your master is away. You can’t tell when he may
return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mother came to visit me, she arrived in the night, afraid.
Rumors had reached her that I was ill. She was ill. It is a long, long walk, from
Nazareth. Peter gave us melon and though it was long past midnight we sat at a
little table under the stars and ate.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is impossible to go on writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I see what is to take place. I am frightened. I must wait
until I have risen from the dead to continue writing. I have spoken to Matthew.
I will entrust my journal to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judas, in a drunken rage, has gone to the authorities and
has promised to de­liver me to them for a sum. He ridiculed me when I refused
to ask God’s pro­tection.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are my final thoughts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I beg You, dear Lord, hear me. Be attentive to my last
supplications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wait, my soul waits. My soul waits for You more than any
who wait for the morning. I say, more than those who watch for the morning.</p>

<p class=LogEntry1stline>Peter’s</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Iyyar 10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tremor roused me and I slowly unwound my grave clothes,
noticing how beautiful they were. I looked at my left hand. I looked at my
right hand. They had healed. The stone that blocked my crypt had been rolled
aside. It was dawn when I went out. Outside I found a discarded robe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sky was grey but sun slanted across spring hills. I
walked toward the sun on a path that led away from the tombs. Perhaps no one
can grasp my bewil­derment and my happiness. I tasted the air. My brain rushed
about, rebounded from a bush, crashed against rocks. Light was splintering
around me; inside that light was the realization that my suffering is over. I
need not die. Life was living in me like a seed, but a perpetual seed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following a path across flowering fields I picked flowers;
then, across the field, I saw Mary Magdalene. She was sobbing, crying. I called
her and she ran to me, saying “Rabboni” over and over. “Dearest...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary and Martha appeared. The women surrounded me, laughing,
touching me, kissing my robe, my hands. Later in the day we set out for Nazareth,
for my home, Mother and Father. Halfway Mother met us and threw her arms around
me—no words were necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That evening, as we ate together, Mother described Father’s
imprisonment. He had sold the gifts of the Magi to obtain bribe money: he
planned to bribe the soldiers to free me. The merchant who bought the gifts
summoned officials. By lying he got Father jailed for theft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It required four days to free him, our Nazarene priests
testifying...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Liberated from death I see life as a singular continuity, a
continuity embody­ing my imperfections, many hopes. I find a new calm in all
that I experience: as I project into tomorrow I sense this serenity. Simplicity
itself wears an aura of riches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tonight, living in this composure, I write freely. Time, as
a force, has dropped away. Pressures are comprehensible such as the stress at
our last supper, the betrayal of Judas. Though I held my emotions in check I
felt  confused by many doubts: above all I felt that my ministry would fail.
Ah, that white room, those shadows, our courage as we sipped salt water in
memory of the Egyptian exodus. Those faces as we sang. Now those memories are
glassed inside a mir­ror, unblemished. And I may open that mirror and
experience a memory or I may close the surface.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I stand alone. It is a beautiful feeling. I stand here
without past and without future. I am a naked man, a man of the wilderness.
This is the miracle of self. The mind owns itself. It does not ask. Acceptance
blocks out intrusion. Each of us should experience the wilderness of mind.</p>

<p class=LogEntry>Iyyar 18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is how it was:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I knelt in the garden I thought of John and his prison
bars, for around me were bars of shrubbery, blacker than any I had seen.
Immobile bars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Death was in the bars and in the air around me, imagined but
none the less real, as real as death had been in the street that day men wanted
to stone the woman taken in adultery. This was my death—I listened for
approaching sol­diers, for the voice of Judas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If it is possible,” I prayed, “let this cup pass from me
quickly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I heard the brook below: it had a place to go. I had this,
this waiting, this ex­pectancy, my disciples asleep on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Death...death is the ransom for man’s sin, I reminded
myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cries of sentinels rang out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judas knew that I was here, that I had come here to pray;
presently I heard the unmistakable clank of side arms and men’s voices, foreign
speech. I could wait no longer. I stood up and waited for Judas to identify me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stumbling over shrubbery, Judas called.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who are you looking for?” I asked a soldier carrying a
torch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jesus of Nazareth,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I am Jesus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lanterns and torches appeared. Peter saw and heard the
soldiers and snatch­ing a sword from one of the guards he slashed a man’s ear.
I rebuked him and cared for the guard, an Arabian named Malchus, who was
singularly afraid of me, afraid of the garden, his task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We shouldn’t have come...you were praying...this is the
garden where you come to pray,” Malchus said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is Judas with you?” I asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He has gone... I’m captain here...you must come with us. We
have been commanded to take you to the high priest, Ananias.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You take me with swords and shields—like a thief. I taught
in the temple... I prayed daily for you...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malchus, his face in torchlight, mumbled in Arabian and
turned away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Leave him alone...get out of here,” Peter shouted; I saw
the guards struggle with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malchus led me along the narrow streets, dark. People lay
asleep in corners and doorways. Donkeys were hobbled together. We walked over
piles of gar­bage. As we filed toward the house of Ananias wind smoked our
torches. At the door of the house we were kept waiting. Two of my guards fell
asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amid bickering I was led into a small room and left there;
then, late in the morning, I was brought before Caiaphas, before scribes and
elders, in an open courtyard. There I heard someone say that it is expedient
for us that he die for his people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Caiaphas asked me about my teachings and I responded:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have spoken openly. I have taught in the synagogues of
Nazareth and Cana and Capernaum and in this city... I have said nothing in
secret. Ask those who have heard me what I have said.” I spoke tersely because
I realized this was a false trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the scribes struck me across my face and hurled me to
the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Witnesses were brought—citizens. One testified that I had
vowed to destroy the temple within three days and rebuild it without hands.
Other witnesses dis­agreed. A woman said I faked miracles. A man testified I
had threatened to de­pose the governor. Others disagreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you Christ...are you the man the people call Christ?”
Caiaphas asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I am.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A priest gestured; he seemed to tear his robe. Caiaphas
smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have heard this blasphemy,” he said. “We need no more
witnesses. I condemn this man to death.” I knew nothing more could be said in
my defense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I sit at my table, underneath the trees, at Peter’s home,
I write as if I were writing about someone else, a friend perhaps. I write
without prejudice. I am shaken by man’s corruption and yet my lack of faith in
man does not influence my writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was left in the hands of guards and palace servants and
then I was led into a room where my hands were roped behind me. I was thrown on
the floor and beaten and kicked and spat on. Men placed me in a chair and
covered my eyes and asked me to guess who struck me, everyone laughing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I fell asleep on the floor and was wakened for a trial
before priests, elders, scribes, in a marble-floored room, Roman insignia on
the wall, the room icy, airless, officers and soldiers at one end, one of them
in battle gear—to impress me, I thought. But I was scarcely able to stand,
scarcely able to think. My hands on the back of a chair, I put my mind to work:
I singled out my home, its doors, its windows, the grass growing in the street.
I forced myself to visualize my mother and father. Though I was in pain I
remembered my little friend, Amos: we were kneeling in the dust before my house,
playing marbles: dust flipped as we shot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was asked if I was the son of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trial was not a trial. There were no witnesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Temple officials conferred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roman authority was not involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A judge or priest condemned me to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such authority had been denied forty years ago by the
Romans. Being aware of this added to my resentment; I tried to speak out but
was silenced. From the courtyard I was marched to the paved square called
Babbatha; troops lined the square, spectators gathered. The sun’s warmth
lessened my pain. One of the guards, secretly, gave me bread. I saw Judas with
Pontius Pilate; Pilate was ac­companied by councilors, guards. I felt I had
been hurled into a wholly alien world—enemy world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pilate, stepping forward in his robe, asked Caiaphas the
nature of my crime. I will remember that scarlet robe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Caiaphas, annoyed, said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If he were not a malefactor we would not bring him before
you.” Pilate un­derstood the evasion. He responded:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Take him, judge him according to your law.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A priest declared:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We found this man saying he was Christ the King.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps Pilate was remembering his troubled past, the
servitude of his an­cestors, some problem, for he hesitated, suspecting a ruse,
that the priests were deceiving him. He must have known that I had not preached
revolt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you king of the Jews?” he asked, motioning me to come
closer. “Your people have brought you here. What have you done?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My kingdom is not of this world.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you a king?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I was born to bear witness to the truth.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pilate shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is truth?” He resumed his seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I did not respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is truth?” he repeated. He waited a little while and
then said, looking at me closely: “I find no fault in this man.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spectators and priests protested. Someone shouted:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He stirs up the people from here to Galilee. He’s a
troublemaker. He drove us out of our temple market.<sup>”</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment Pilate may have become aware of my accent or
remembered I was born in Nazareth for he ordered me brought to trial before
Herod, the local governor. Herod, I thought, the name stunning me as I recalled
his crime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We crossed a bridge, a hostile crowd following; young Herod
welcomed me because he had heard of my miracles and wanted me to perform for
his benefit. Was I wizard, necromancer, fakir?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could not speak to this murderer: I envisioned John in
prison, waiting, waiting for the liberty that never came. I saw his decapitated
head on a tray, dis­played for a dancing girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because I could not speak Herod had his men throw a purple
robe over my shoulders and place me on a chair. They mocked me, spat on me, and
demanded I save myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Herod refused to try me and ordered guards to return me to
Pontius Pilate. It was then, as we recrossed the bridge where the populace
jeered, it was then I attempted to think of home. Something like an actual wall
blocked me. All the emptiness of life, the savageness of the wilderness, the
enmity of mankind, came into being. I prayed but prayer was useless. A man held
my arm or I would have fallen: his sword hit my side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pilate resented a jeering mob and tried to establish order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He commanded men to assume positions in the Babbatha yard.
Calling sev­eral priests, he said, shouting at them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have brought this man before me. You say he perverts
the people. I find no fault in him. I will punish him and release him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sat on his tribunal chair, his wife beside him. Raising
his hand he re­sumed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I will free a man. Who will it be? Barabbas? Do you want
Barabbas free or Christ? Choose your man.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Barabbas...Barabbas,” the priests shouted, and the crowd
repeated his name, a man known for his crimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What shall I do with Jesus?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Crucify him...crucify him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What has he done?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crowd answered: “Crucify him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shall I continue this journal? Will others accept my
account? Shall I simply destroy these words? As days pass I am able to re-live
the sadness. There is a chance to diminish man’s cruelty. I take that chance.
We are here in this world to make life worthy. We are here to teach others.
Teaching is no easier than learn­ing. No one has ever had my vantage point:
this permits me to continue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I searched for a friendly face among the
mob...Peter...Mother...Matthew... Clibus...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=239 height=321
src="images/image013.png" alt="" align=left
hspace=6 style='margin-left:-6px;margin-right:6px'>Barabbas was brought before
the judges and liberated with jeers and laughter. He passed by me, a great,
tall man. As he walked away I was led to a whipping post, bound, and lashed
with thongs; I was lashed until unconscious. Courage, where was my courage to
bear the cru­cifixion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tried to think...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a barren hall soldiers stripped me and put a filthy robe
around me and forced a crown of thorns on my head. Six or eight men confronted
me. They mocked me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hail, king of the Jews,” they hol­lered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Priests appeared and cried: “Crucify him...he calls himself
the Son of God. Kill him.” Pilate appeared and asked: “Who are you?” I could
not speak be­cause of pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Speak to me...don’t you realize I have the power to set you
free.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was thinking of Judas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Roman officer spoke out: “He’s an enemy of Rome...he
defies Caesar.” “Our emperor is Caesar,” a priest shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Take him away,” Pilate said. “He is yours.” He took water
and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of the blood of this
man,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again I looked for my disciples but now a centurion in
cuirass and armed soldiers, carrying shields, grabbed me and forced me outside.
“To the cross,” someone said. “To the cross,” another repeated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was amazed to find myself walking. It isn’t far, it isn’t
far, I told myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We descended a stepped path. The bridge lay ahead. People
jammed the bridge. We climbed a steep bank, passed houses, trees, rocks. The
centurion ordered me to carry the crossbeam. As he compelled me to take the
beam he gave me water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was nearly noon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I shouldered the beam, fell, tried again. The officer
ordered an onlooker to carry the beam. I heard a priest shout: “If any man
wishes to prove the inno­cence of Jesus, let him speak.” His voice, his robe,
the beam, the crowd... I can’t remember. Yet I remember men selling dates,
hawking fruit. I wanted the food of earth, life itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My mother broke through the crowd and embraced me. A little
farther on I heard Lazarus call. I saw Martha. She was kneeling, reaching
toward me. Peter, Luke, Clibus, Mark. I saw. I loved them, their faces like old
graven coins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I saw them all the way to the spot where they laid the cross
on the ground. I prayed for courage, strength to endure, as they stripped off
my clothes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then men pounded a nail through my hand and I was blinded,
torn with pain. Then I felt greater pain as they pounded a nail through my legs
and then I felt no more pain until I hung on the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I looked and looked but could make out nothing; then I saw
two men hang­ing on crosses beside me. I looked at them and they looked at me.
I saw people below me; I heard women and children crying. I tried to speak to
them. But as I hung there everything began to move away from me: a great
distance swam around me. I thought of a mirage. Someone put a sponge to my
mouth. Then I saw my mother, I saw Martha, Lazarus, people I had cured. A
soldier shoved his spear into me. I tried to say something... That is all that
I remember.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joseph of Arimathea obtained permission to remove my body
from the cross. He and my disciples placed it in his family crypt. He provided
a robe and cloth to cover my face. I lay in his tomb, myrrh and aloe about me;
there I lay for three days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>eter is a descendant of a nomadic
tribe. Euodia, his mother, is a gnarled woman, dark, serious. She and Peter
built this house after her husband died. She had had enough of desert
privation. Last night she spread a special table for my homecoming: pomegranate
juice, melon, cheese, bread, nuts, chromis and another fish, clarias, my
favorite. Euodia is an expert with olive oil—perhaps some are nomad recipes. At
supper time she accepted me easily; Matthew and Peter were wary, afraid, shy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While we were eating, Peter said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Master, how can it be you were crucified eight days ago...
Can you say that you are well?” He brushed his hand over his yellow beard. “I
couldn’t forget the terror...will you help us understand? When all of us meet
will you explain? Is it faith?...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were eating at a makeshift table under Peter’s olives; it
was well after sunset and we felt the quiet of the extensive fields that make
Peter’s home a retreat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Matthew, picking at his supper, nervous, kept watching my hands—I
knew he was studying the scars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hope you never return to Jerusalem,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I agreed: I agreed for several reasons: one reason was my
desire to send my disciples to remote places, villages, towns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Our work is to be carried out among our countrymen while
governments interfere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We love you...we had nothing to do with the crucifixion,”
Euodia blurted out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love, love after crucifixion is a brilliant but black
enigma: it proffers and de­nies. We know that love helps us forget pain;
however I ask myself whether it is evil to forget evil. But I can think of
resurrection as a form of love, a love be­yond supplication. I take that step
and realize that immortality is another form of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Desert air pushed in as we finished our meal and we soon felt
chilled. I wanted to shed my fatigue by reading but we discussed visiting the
spring at Neby. I suggested we leave early if it did not rain during the night
and bog the paths. At Neby I wanted to work out a plan for James, Peter and
Matthew, if James joined us. When government cruelty diminishes I want Peter to
preach in Rome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my bedroom I read <i>Ecclesiastes</i>—drowsing at times,
aware of my familiar pallet, the good pillow, the candles. I was able to
dismiss the imminence of de­parture. I put it away like a shell under sea
grass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Ecclesiastes</i> meant more to me than weeks ago as I
read and re-read passages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rain woke me during the night—a pleasant shower smelling
like spring. So, we would walk to Neby another day. Here I would be able to go
on reading <i>Ec­clesiastes </i>and Peter’s copy of the <i>Psalms</i>. When I
told Peter that Clibus had found the <i>Ecclesiastes </i>scroll on a trip to
the upper Nile they were astonished. They had never seen so ancient a scroll.</p>

erecting a large striped tent.</p>

their lives? These men know ambition and is ambition the safe route? Verily,
verily “all is vanity and vexation of spirit,” if we listen to <i>Ecclesiastes</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal>Sivan is a beautiful month, a month of subtle changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I lay in deep grass yesterday. While I lay in the grass I
remembered the fields around Nazareth and I remembered climbing olive trees at
harvest time—how we sang and shook down the ripe fruit onto nets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mama made the finest olive oil in Papa’s oil press, the
finest in Nazareth some Nazarenes said. I hurried to fill our baskets... I
wanted to gather more than anyone. I never did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tomorrow I go to villages and will heal the sick...it is a
joy, a joy rather kin­dred to lying in deep grass in the warm sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have read my journal. I will return it to Matthew’s care.
Among our disci­ples he is the most reliable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, as I write with my bronze stylus, I listen to the
evening, familiar sounds; through my window I see the Milky Way and the great
constellations and I am aware God is affirming his handiwork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I write very slowly, lingering over each letter, the square
letters superior to the old script. I go on listening. The lamp burns steadily.
There is no wind. There is gratitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father has suffered from his imprisonment. His hands
tremble. After seeing me on the cross he is unable to believe that I am alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I held out my arms to him as we stood in front of our home.
He backed away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“...Father, remember how we visited together at Qumran?
Remember that old long-bladed saw, how I repaired its handle three times?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mama gave you that shirt at the Feast of Lights...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned and walked away, trembling.</p>

<p class=Symbolseparator><span style='font-family:Webdings'>ÿ</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I was staying at the home of Gehazi, after preaching in
the synagogue, after healing, Barabbas appeared. Jamnia is his village and he
entered the house of Gehazi without knocking. A great tall hulk, he loomed over
me; then he knelt and begged me to accept him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dressed in goat’s skin, his face and beard wild, he seemed
ill, perhaps de­ranged. I tried to calm him, to reason with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I should have been crucified,” he repeated in a hoarse
voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a long while we remained together, talking, praying,
hoping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patience—we need patience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Going from village to village, town to town, means walking
five days, four days, two. It is a five day walk to Nazareth. It is a two day
walk to the village of Gehazi. Most walks are pleasant. It can be cold, windy,
hot; and when it rains there is seldom any shelter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes we travel together; sometimes we walk alone; these
days I prefer my solitary walks. I am aware of close communion when alone.
Patience, pa­tience...but the calendar moves on: Shevat, Adar, Nisan, Iyyar,

hspace=144 vspace=10>aul Alexander Bartlett (1909-1990) was a writer and
artist, born in Moberly, Missouri, and educated at Oberlin College, the
University of Arizona, the Academia de San Carlos in Mexico City, and the
Instituto de Bellas Artes in Guadalajara. His work can be divided into three
categories: He is the author of many novels, short stories, and poems; second,
as a fine artist, his drawings, illustrations, and paintings have been ex­hibited
in more than forty one-man shows in leading galleries, including the Los
Angeles County Museum, the Atlanta Art Museum, the Bancroft Library, the
Richmond Art Institute, the Brooks Museum, the
Instituto-Mexicano-Norteamericano in Mexico City, and many other galleries;
and, third, he devoted much of his life to the most comprehensive study of the
haciendas of Mexico that has been undertaken. More than 350 of his pen-and-ink
illustrations of the haciendas and more than one thousand hacienda photographs
make up the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection held by the Nettie Lee Benson
Latin American Collection of the University of Texas, and form part of a second
diversified col­lection held by the American Heritage Center of the University
of Wyoming, which also includes an archive of Bartlett’s literary work, fine
art, and letters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul Alexander Bartlett’s fiction has been commended by many
authors, among them Pearl Buck, Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, James
Michener, Upton Sinclair, Evelyn Eaton, and many others. He was the recipient
of many grants, awards, and fellowships, from such organizations as the Leopold
Schepp Foundation, the Edward MacDowell Association, the New School for Social
Research, the Huntington Hartford Foundation, the Montalvo Foundation, and the
Carnegie Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His wife, Elizabeth Bartlett, a widely published poet, is
the author of seven­teen published books of poetry, numerous poems, short
stories, and essays pub­lished in leading literary quarterlies and anthologies,
and, as the founder of Literary Olympics, Inc., is the editor of a series of
multi-language volumes of international poetry that honor the work of
outstanding contemporary poets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul and Elizabeth’s son, Steven, edited and designed this
volume.</p>

typeface is </span><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>named after Claude Garamond
(c. 1480-1561), a French type designer and publisher and the world’s first
commercial typefounder. Garamond’s contribution to the history of typesetting
was substantial. He perfected the design of Roman type: The fonts that he cut
beginning in 1531 were recognized as possessing a superior grace and clarity,
so much so that Garamond’s fonts influenced European printing for the next cen­tury
and a half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>It
is interesting to note that Garamond type is the evolutionary ancestor of the
type used to print the first official copies of the Declaration of
Independence. In the 1730s, Englishman William Caslon refined Garamond’s
version of Aldine roman, the well-balanced typeface became popular, and was
introduced to the American colonies by Benjamin Franklin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>Despite

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>During
the past five centuries, so many variations of Garamond’s type designs have

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
